    A Mini-Eiffel parser implementation.

  <h3>About the exception model</h3>
  <p>
    As you can see from the API documentation of the parser, unchecked
    exceptions are used throughout the code. This is a conscious choice
    that contributes to the overall readability of the code: instead of
    having most of the methods in Lexer (for example) declaring
    'java.io.IOException' in their throws clause, our own version of the
    exception is unchecked and can thus propagate up the
    caller stack up to the point where it's handled without having
    to declare a throws clause in each of the methods on the way.
